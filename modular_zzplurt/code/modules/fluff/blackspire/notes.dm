So here's how it goes, we've given you a keycard to access most of the maintenance areas in each sector, mainly the crew sector- It'll be located in your filing cabinet. Your primary job is to fix any broken machines, hack any vendors that someone asks you to, repair any mishaps the two idiots in Hydroponics cause. It's simple, good luck."

The Lead Researcher will thank me someday, anyway.. I'm putting the password to the room with the button here to remember it, it's 'Death to Nanotrasen'."
